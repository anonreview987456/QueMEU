# QueMEU
This is the anonymous partial repository for the paper "Coevolutionary Heuristics for Maximization of Expected Utility." It contains excerpts relevant for running trials and plotting/analyzing data. The full codebase with utilities will be released in the event of acceptance for publication.

* Please see test/quemeu/run.jl for an entry point for running trials.
* configurations/quemeu contains organizing configuration code
* ecosystems/quemeu contains most of the algorithm code for executing the Standard, Advanced, and QueMEU conditions.
* test/quemeu/plot.jl contains plotting code for generating figures,
* test/quemeu/analyze.jl contains code for statistical analysis.
* Other files in genotype, phenotype, etc., support the core evolutionary algorithm.
